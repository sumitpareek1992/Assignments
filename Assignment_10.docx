	destFolder = os.path.abspath(destFolder)
	print('Looking in', folder, 'for files with extensions 	of','.join(extensions))
	for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(folder):
		for filename in filenames:
			name, extension = os.path.splitext(filename)
			if extension in extensions:
				fileAbsPath = foldername + os.path.sep + filename
				print('Coping', fileAbsPath, 'to', destFolder)
